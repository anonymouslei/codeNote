#geometry calculations with lanelet2
lanenelt2 primitives interface with `Boost.Geometry`.Boost.Geometry offers almost
all common geometry calculations and is very fast. One downside
is that not all algorithms work well with normal Lanelet2 primitives.
Another downside is that Boost.Geometry is compile-time heavy
and thus not included in the normal lanelet2 headers.
to use geometry calculations, include the respective geometry header.
