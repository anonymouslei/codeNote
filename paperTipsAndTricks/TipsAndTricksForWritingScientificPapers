## Typesetting your paper
[reference](https://github.com/Wookai/paper-tips-and-trick****s)
### one sentence per line
### capitalization

we will refer below to two types of capitalization:

- sentence format: The title of the nice book
- title format: the Title of the Nice Book

use title format for all section, subsection, etc. titles. 

### tables
[booktabs](https://www.ctan.org/pkg/booktabs) can help you produce clean and nice-looking tables.
In general, avoid using vertical lines in your tables.
Instead, if you want to group columns, do it in the headers using
`\cmidrule`.
you can also replace horizontal lines with spacing, using `addlinespace` 

### number formatting
Use the [siunitx](https://ctan.org/pkg/siunitx) package to format all numbers, currencies, units, etc:

## mathematical notation

when writing equations, it is helpful to have a coherent and
consistent way of writing variables, vectors, matrices, etc.
It helps the reader identifying what you are talking about and remembering the semantics of each symbol.

### Notation
we propose the following rules for writing math:
- lowercase italic for variables:(`$x$`)
- lowercase italic bold for vectors:(`$\mathbold{x}$`)
- uppercase italic bold for matrices: (`$\mathbold{x}$`)
- uppercase italic for random variables: (`$X$`)

the `\mathbold` command comes from the `fixmath` package and is similar to `\boldmath` or `\bm`,
except that all symbols are in italics, even greek letters(other packages do notitalicize greek letters)

when adding indices or exponents to variables,
make sure that you add them outside of the styling of the variable,
i.e. write `$\mathbold{x}_i$` and not `$\mathbold{x_i}$`.

#### define custom commands
because we often refer to variables, we suggest defining the following two commands:
```
\renewcommand{\vec}[1]{\mathbold{#1}}
\newcommand{\mat}[1]{\mathbold{#1}}
``` 
you can then use `$\vec{x}$` and `$\mat{X}$` in your document.
if you decide to change the way you want to format matrices,
you simply have to change the `\mat` command, and it will update
the whole document. -- 没看懂这里

we also suggest defining commands for the variables you use the most.
for example, if you use `\vex{x}` and `\mat{x}` a lot, consider defining these command:
```
\newcommand{\vx}{\vec{x}}
\newcommand{\vX}{\mat{X}}
```
#### use the correct notation for columns et elements
note that you should always style the variables with respect to their type.
For example, the $i$th element of
